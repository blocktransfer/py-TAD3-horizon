### Testing Configuration

Create a new folder titled `master-identity-catalog-records` in the same directory as `stellar-interface`

In that folder, add `exampleMICR` from `/issuers`

Rename to `master-identity-account-mapping.txt`

- This is soon to be depricated in favor of programmatic PII access and management.
- We will work on publishing a test database for external audit workflows in due time.

## Things we will never do
1. Charge fees for standard activities
2. Sell investor data to third parties
3. Set unrequired trading restrictions
