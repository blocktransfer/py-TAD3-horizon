THIS DOCUMENT CREATED PER COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934,
SUBPARAGRAPHS 17Ad-15(c)–17Ad-15(e) — SIGNATURE GUARANTEE PROGRAM

BlockTrans Syndicate ("Block Transfer") engages in all guarantee activities, as
defined in Subsection 17Ad-15(a)(3) and referenced herein, with equitable
treatment of all eligible guarantor institution and classes of institutions.

Block Transfer uses cryptographic signatures
perpetually stored in the immutable Stellar blockchain for the acceptance of
guarantees of securities transfers from eligible guarantor institutions.
Individual asset holders are held to this same security standard for transfers.
Stellar uses base-32 encoding of Ed25519 keys generated by asset holders.
Holders sign and broadcast Stellar transfers to the blockchain network using
their keys. Anyone with a holder's keys can sign a transfer on their behalf,
so eligible guarantor institutions and Individuals alike should maintain
enormous security of their private keys, as best as possible. Participants can
generate a keypair through any standard Stellar wallet and request it be linked
with their identity by Block Transfer. Further instructions on this process
are available in our investor portal. See https://www.blocktransfer.io

Guarantees are made through cryptographic signing of an instruction of transfer
or security endorsement by a participant with their private key. This signature
is cryptographically verified given the transfer amount, participants, nonce, etc.
So long as the transfer is valid with the claimed signing public key, the
guarantee is accepted by the network no matter (and blind to) the original broadcaster.
Otherwise, the transfer is rejected, and participants are immediately notified
by the network why their signature and thus transfer was invalid via standard
error codes in tandem with a local copy of the submitted invalid transfer.
Due to (i) local checks for signature validity in standard wallet interfaces and
(ii) haulted gossip propagation of invalid transactions on the Stellar blockchain, Block
Transfer will, in a vast bulk of instances, not be made aware of rejected transfers
given only a narrow range of transfers are invalid by false attestation, while
all validly-signed transfers are accepted by honest validating peers who also check the signature.

Block Transfer accepts and internalizes the risk of financial loss in the event
persons have no recourse against any eligible guarantor institution and, in the
opinion of its principals, maintains adequate protection against the issuance
of unauthorized guarantees since such guarantees would equate to infeasibly
breaking EdDSA given holders maintain robust security of their private keys.

Block Transfer retains the right to clawback assets sent in transfers if some
participant can prove beyond all reasonable doubt that their secret key was
stolen or they were violently coerced into a transfer. Such cases will generally
be taken to a reliable local court of law, and theft or coercion must be proved.
See our transfer standards.

As soon as some good-standing (meaning passed KYC, etc.) participant broadcasts
a valid signed transfer to the Stellar network, Block Transfer can in no
meaningful way stop the transfer from confirming regardless of the originating
sender. Block Transfer accepts all account balances on the Stellar ledger as
material fact in the control book and master securityhodler files of issuers.

Upon transfer from a given issuer's prior transfer agent, all certificate-
holding shareholders will be notified that they must validate their Block
Transfer blockchain account on the Stellar network at no cost to them. At that
point, Block Transfer will credit said shareholders with their paper balances
in DRS form. Old paper certificates will thus be null and void, and
transferring shareholders maintain the same shares in their Stellar wallet.

Block Transfer does not make a market for any of the issuers it services.
Block Transfer will not accept payment of securities in exchange for value.

I attest to the validity of this signature guarantee program and, under penalty
of purgery, claim its standards to be the operating by-laws of Block Transfer.
