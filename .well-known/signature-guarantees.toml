SIGNATURE_GUARANTEE_PROGRAM_SPECIFICATION = "BlockTrans Syndicate ('Block
Transfer' herein) engages in all guarantee activities, as defined in Subsection
17Ad-15(a)(3) and referenced herein, with equitable treatment of all eligible
guarantor institutions and classes of institutions.

Block Transfer uses cryptographic signatures perpetually stored in the immutable
Stellar blockchain for the acceptance of guarantees of securities transfers from
eligible guarantor institutions. Individual asset holders are held to this same
security standard for transfers. Stellar uses base-32 encoded Ed25519 keys
generated by asset holders. Holders sign and broadcast Stellar transfers to the
blockchain network using their keys. Anyone with a holder's keys can sign a
transfer on their behalf, so eligible guarantor institutions and individuals
alike should maintain utmost secrecy of their private keys, as best as able.
Participants can generate a keypair through any standard Stellar wallet and
request it be linked with their identity by Block Transfer. Further instructions
on this process are available in our investor portal. The process requires no
more than a mobile phone and five minutes; anyone can easily onboard quickly.

Guarantees are made and verified through private-key cryptographic sigantures of
instructions to transfer an asset or endorse a transfer. Participants can
automatically generate such digital signatures through an standard Stellar
wallet, though we reccomend Lobstr. So long as the transfer is valid with the
claimed signing public key, the guarantee is accepted by the network no matter
(and blind to) the original broadcaster. Otherwise, the transfer is rejected,
and participants are immediately notified by the network why their signature and
thus transfer was invalid via standard error codes in tandem with a local copy
of the submitted invalid transfer. Due to (i) local checks for signature
validity in standard wallet interfaces and (ii) haulted gossip propagation of
invalid transactions on the Stellar blockchain, Block Transfer will, in a vast
bulk of instances, not be made aware of rejected transfers given only a narrow
range of transfers are invalid by false cryptographic attestation, while valid
transfer signatures are instantaneously accepted by honest validating peers.

Block Transfer accepts and internalizes the risk of financial loss in the event
persons have no recourse against any eligible guarantor institution and, in the
opinion of its principals, maintains adequate protection against the issuance
of unauthorized guarantees since such guarantees would equate to infeasibly
breaking EdDSA given holders maintain robust security of their private keys.

Block Transfer retains the right to clawback assets sent in transfers if some
participant can prove beyond all reasonable doubt that their secret key was
stolen or they were violently coerced into a transfer. Such cases must prove
theft or coercion in a competent court of law, as deemed fit by Block Transfer.

As soon as some good-standing (meaning passed KYC, etc.) participant broadcasts
a valid signed transfer to the Stellar network, Block Transfer can in no
meaningful way stop the transfer from confirming regardless of the originating
sender. Block Transfer accepts all account balances on the Stellar ledger as
material fact in the control book and master securityhodler files of issuers.

Upon change from a given issuer's prior transfer agent, all certificate-holding
shareholders must validate their Stellar blockchain account at no cost to them
through Block Transfer's KYC onboarding. Block Transfer will credit physcial
shareholders with their ownership stakes in DRS form on the Stellar blockchain.
Old paper certificates are thus null and void. We will never issue certificates.

Block Transfer does not make a market for any of the issuers it services. Block
Transfer will not directly accept or make payment with securities in exchange
for value, except in the case of tender offers or approved corporate mergers.
Rather, all good-standing market participants can directly trade assets through
Stellar's decentralized exchange by signing order messages in their wallet."

ATTESTATION = "The Board approves principal John Wooten to speak on its behalf.
We attest to the validity of this signature guarantee program and, under penalty
of purgery, claim its standards to be the operating by-laws of Block Transfer.
