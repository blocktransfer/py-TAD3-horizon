The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Section 14A(a) rerquires that all institutional securityholders per Section 13(f) of the Exchange Act report how they voted on say-on-pay votes at least annually. Block Transfer accounts for votes directly on the blockchain per its Shareholder Voting System detailed in US 63/156,267 wherein votes are recorded as memo text on Stellar as strings of up to Yay/Nay/Abstain ("Y,N,A") votes on issuer-generated ballots. Such strings (e.g. YNAAAYYYYY) are meaningless without knowledge of the underlying proxy voting materials. Thus, this folders stores such information which can at any time be publicly accessed and each item's revision history preservation verified. Therefore, institutional book-entry shareholders which fall under this legal requirement of disclosing investment voting history can simply reveal the public key they use to hold assets with Block Transfer and anyone can clearly see what they voted on based on the public transaction memos sent to Block-Transfer-established voting addresses (see Federation server if unfamiliar with finding such votes via a block explorer).
