NO_INCOME_CLAIMS = "We approximated the ~0.5% difference between brokerage and
direct-registered investment portfolios for an equally-weighted all-cap equity
portfolio at a leading broker with 12 diversified security purchases per month.
This figure does not accord for systematic devaluations of securities due to
excess sales of nonexistent shares, remarkably higher spreads for derivatives,
expense ratios for baskets of shares that could be acquired en mass individually
given efficient bulk trading functionality, improper tax classifications of cash
in lieu of dividends, or lack of portfolio cash or securities interest income."
