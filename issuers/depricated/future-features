Features to impliment: 

- Dashboard login with issuer info linked to their asset and PII ... or just [insert asset code] and then upload some PII CSV, securely updated monthly
- Display merged shareholders based on blockchain balances
- Display history of shareholders (number of them, average holdings, etc)
- Top buyers based on DEX activity
- Ditto for sellers
- Percent held by institutions based on nameInstution in PII vs. nameFirst, nameMiddle, nameLast, nameSuffix; given principals not listed
- Trend of institutional vs. individual book-entry holders 


One effective way to do this is to fork a desktop wallet and then use issuer credentials to authenticate AES encrypted GET requests to an MSF.csv API. In progress
